                    An artist who lives and works in Atlanta Georgia. While she makes her
                    living in the film industry, she understands the inherent philosophical difference
                    between photography and cinematography, as reflected in her work. Her current
                    ambition is to understand the overlap between an art and a craft, while her life’s
                    ambition is to master four arts, one of which is photography. Her retirement plan
                    is to get a master’s degree in Library Science.
                </p>

                    While she believes in the value of receiving a good education, crafting has existed
                    for many years outside of the university college system. She actively seeks out
                    various masters to learn from and will continue to hone her various crafts.
                    Michelle is very much in touch with her heritage, allowing for her unique
                    perspective to been seen through her work.
