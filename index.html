                        An artist who lives and works in Atlanta Georgia. While she makes her
                        living in the film industry, she understands the inherent philosophical difference
                        between photography and cinematography, as reflected in her work. Her current
                        ambition is to understand the overlap between an art and a craft, while her life’s
                        ambition is to master four arts, one of which is photography. Her retirement plan
                        is to get a master’s degree in Library Science.

                        While she believes in the value of receiving a good education, crafting has existed
                        for many years outside of the university college system. She actively seeks out
                        various masters to learn from and will continue to hone her various crafts.
                        Michelle is very much in touch with her heritage, allowing for her unique
                        perspective to been seen through her work.
